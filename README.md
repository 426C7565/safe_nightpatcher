##Requirements

+ Windows Vista or higher (Mac and Linux users, use Wine)
+ [.NET Framework 4.5.2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=328843)
+ Wii U FW v5.5.1 or below
+ Splatoon with v2.12.0
+ TCPGecko + kernel from loadiine.ovh website, Dimok's [TCPGecko elf](http://wiiubru.com/appstore/#/app/TCPgecko), or [geckiine](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-geckiine-tcpgecko-and-cafiine-combined.433057/)

##Usage

+ Connect, choose the maps you want set to night mode, and click poke.

##Known issues

+ Hammerhead Bridge causes bad desync issues when played online.  You aren't restricted from using it, but it's not recommended.  The program will confirm if you want to poke the map if you check its checkbox.

+ amibu for the geckomaptester source, Bkool999 for putting everything together and coding the program, OatmealDome for finding the offsets, and Yahya for small bits of code taken from Octoslots.
